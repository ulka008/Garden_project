This is my garden project, which includes some information on the herb garden we started with my children during a lockdown.
It includes the most common herbs, their pictures, latin names and germination days.

index.html: contains jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap for my tabs and modal picture box for plants and images. I also used flex-container for the list on the supplies page.

img folder: contains images used on my site. Images were downloaded from unsplash.com and are free for personal use.

media.css, countdown.css and form.css: contain style for my pages, including sticky footer and media queries.

countdown.js: contains countdown clock to our harvest.

form.js: contains regex for my contact form.

directory.js: contains arrays, a formula to extract information on my plants and display it on my site via zoom-in and a fetch request. 

plants.json: contains a table that displays herbs.

server.js: contains API.

gardening tips.txt is just an outline for myself with the info on my site.

IMPORTANT: please use http://localhost:8080 in order to fetch API and see plants and information pertaining to them under the Herbs tab. You would also need to have node.js installed on your computer.
