This is my garden project, which includes some information on the herb garden we started with my children during a lockdown.
It includes 10 common herbs, their pictures, latin names and germination days.

index.html: contains jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap for my tabs and modal picture box for plants and images. I also used flex-container for the list of supplies.

media.css: contains style for my pages

img folder: contains images used on my site

directory.js: contains a formula to extract information on my plants and display it on my site. It also contains a table that displays herbs.

gardening tips.txt is just an outline for myself with the info on my site.
